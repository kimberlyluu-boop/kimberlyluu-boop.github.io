    Hi, I’m Kimberly Luu — an Information Technology undergraduate at George Mason University (B.S. expected May 2027)
    concentrating in AI-Driven Solutions. I’m interested in building structured, reliable systems using Python, SQL,
    and data tools like Excel and Power BI.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through coursework and projects, I’ve worked on relational database design (normalization, primary/foreign keys,
    and query writing) and web development using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I care a lot about clarity and organization —
    clean code, clear documentation, and reporting that supports real decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently looking for an IT internship where I can support troubleshooting, documentation, and data-driven
    reporting while continuing to build hands-on experience.
  </p>
